# First Machine Learning Model

This repository contains my first steps into the world of Machine Learning. It demonstrates the implementation of basic machine learning algorithms, data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Overview

This project serves as an introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning. It involves building a simple model using a standard dataset, processing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The goal is to provide a clear, hands-on example for beginners in machine learning.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics.
- **Model Training:** Implement and train a machine learning model using a popular algorithm.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation to guide beginners through the process of building a machine learning model.
